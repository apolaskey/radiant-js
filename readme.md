## Developing
The below should over a no bullshit setup experience if followed; otherwise open an issue and let me know what you encountered.

### First Time Setup

The below are global tools that must be installed to build / package this application

[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) :: ``version must be >= 6.6.0``

[Electron Setup](https://electron.atom.io/) :: ``npm install -g electron``

[Ava](https://github.com/avajs/ava) :: ``npm install -g ava``

[Run-All](https://github.com/mysticatea/npm-run-all/blob/master/docs/run-p.md) :: ``npm install -g npm-run-all``

Build Project Setup & Scripts :: ``npm install && npm run build``

### Build Scripts
Start application in prod mode :: ``npm start``

Start application in dev mode :: ``npm run start-dev``

Start electron only :: ``npm run start-dev:electron``
* Cavaet to this is the bootstrap index.js might get out-of-date since that's not HMR'd

Start webpack HMR only :: ``npm run hot``

Build output :: ``npm run build``

Lint source :: ``npm test``

Run integration tests :: ``npm run build && npm run it-test``

Package application :: ``npm run package:${os-type}`` where ``${os-type}`` is "windows", "linux", "osx"

## Patterns and Practices
Below are the basic towards how the project is setup and in general just how things work.

### Project Directory Structure Overview

All test scripts are to go to ``tests/**`` and be suffixed with ``.test.js`` ie. ``FooBar.test.js``

Anything related to UI for the application goes into ``app/renderer/**``

Anything related to just general purpose work goes into ``app/main/**``

Branching / Merging is Gitflow with two defined core branches

* ``master`` :: Stable Release (Build that passed everything)

* ``stable`` :: Nightly Release (Build that passed automated tests)

* ``latest`` :: Unstable Release (Purely staged work; might work, might not)

Application "Main" is at ``app/index.js``

Application routing is configured at ``app/renderer/editor-routes.js``

# Known Issues

Error Like: ``cross-env not available``
* To fix run ``npm rebuild`` this is required because your likely carrying project files between multiple
OS variants

White page when running ``npm run start-dev``
* This usually happens if the Electron Window is minimized while Webpack is building out the HMR server
just refresh the page (Ctrl/Cmd R or View -> Reload)

Webpack HMR not working for index.ejs or index.js
* I don't believe it's possible to get around this without jumping through some crazy hoops.
This is because when launching Electron via the CLI it expects some assets to be available to open
the main window. For the sake of simplicity this is going to be left alone.

Warning like: ``npm WARN invalid config loglevel="notice"``
* To fix the above just run ``npm config set loglevel warn`` the above occurs on Windows environments
running NPM >= 6 due to the newer auto-enabled package-lock.json functionality

Warning like: ``MaxListenersExceededWarning: Possible EventEmitter memory leak detected. `` is displayed
* To fix the above issue update NPM to ``>= 4.4.4`` can be done by doing ``npm update -g npm``
